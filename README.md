## About<!-- Required -->
Welcome to the repository for the projects completed in **Week 7** of the bootcamp. This week, we covered a variety of topics and built several key projects to strengthen our skills.

<!-- 
* information about the project 
* 
* keep it short and sweet
-->


## Overview<!-- Required -->
<!-- 
* Here you may add information about how 
* 
* and why to use this project.
-->
In this week, we focused on the following key areas:

- LINQ query operations
- Working with collections such as lists and arrays
- Object creation and manipulation with dynamic user inputs
- Implementing join and group join operations in LINQ

<!--## Demo<!-- Required -->
<!-- 
* You can add a demo here GH supports images/ GIFs/videos 
* 
* It's recommended to use GIFs as they are more dynamic
-->
## Projects Included
- **Project 1: LINQ Practice**  
  Created a program that generates a list of 10 random numbers and uses LINQ queries to filter and display:
  - Even numbers
  - Odd numbers
  - Negative numbers
  - Positive numbers
  - Numbers greater than 15 and less than 22
  - Squares of each number (created and displayed in a new list)

- **Project 2: Artist Database**  
  Developed a program with a list of artist objects, each containing details like name and album sales. LINQ queries performed:
  - Finding singers whose names start with 'S'
  - Filtering artists with album sales over 10 million
  - Grouping and sorting singers by debut year and genre, focusing on pop artists who debuted before 2000
  - Finding the artist with the highest album sales
  - Identifying the newest and oldest debuting artist

- **Project 3: Patikaflix Series Platform**  
  Built a series list application where the user adds each series through the console. After creating a series, the user is asked whether they want to add another. The program then:
  - Creates a new list of comedy series, containing only the series name, genre, and director (requires a new class).
  - Displays the new list, sorted by series name first, then by director's name.

- **Project 4: LINQ Join Practice**  
  Developed a library management system with two tables: Authors and Books. Each book has an author connected by a unique AuthorId. The program:
  - Defines classes for Authors and Books
  - Populates both tables with example data (at least 3 authors and 4 books)
  - Creates a LINQ query to join the tables and display the book title along with the author's name
  - Prints the results with the book titles and author's names

- **Project 5: LINQ Group Join Practice**  
  Created a school database with two tables: Students and Classes. The task involves:
  - Defining two classes, `Student` and `Class`, with appropriate data types
  - Performing a group join to list all students grouped by their class
  - Displaying each class along with the students in that class


<!--## Contents Table<!-- Optional -->

* This section is optional, yet having a contents table 
* helps keeping your README readable and more professional.
